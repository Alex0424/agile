# Welcome to Agile Methodology Guide

This comprehensive guide covers agile methodology, DevOps practices, and frameworks to help teams deliver value efficiently and continuously.

## What is Agile?

Agile is a project management and software development methodology that emphasizes:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Agile + DevOps: A Powerful Combination

While Agile focuses on iterative development and team collaboration, **DevOps extends these principles** to operations and deployment. Together, they create a complete framework for modern software delivery:
